## Installation

### Prerequisites

**Python 3.7+** is required for this project.

### Recommended: Installation with UV (Fast Python Package Manager)

[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager written in Rust. It's significantly faster than pip.

#### Step 1: Install UV

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone or navigate to project directory
cd Home_assinment

# Create virtual environment with uv
uv venv

# Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Run the Project

```bash
# Run with uv (automatically uses virtual environment)
uv run python main.py

# Or run with custom population size
uv run python main.py 6000
```

**Alternatively, activate the virtual environment manually:**

Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```

macOS/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

---

### Alternative: Installation with pip

If you prefer traditional pip:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project
python main.py
```

---

### Dependency Details

The project requires three main packages (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)):

- **numpy** (≥1.19.0): Random number generation, array operations, linear algebra
- **scipy** (≥1.5.0): Multivariate normal PDF calculations, convex hull computation
- **matplotlib** (≥3.3.0): Visualization and plotting (confidence ellipses, scatter plots)

**Installed versions with uv:**
- numpy: 1.26.4
- scipy: 1.15.3
- matplotlib: 3.10.7

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run with default parameters (n=10,000 as per PRD):

**With UV (recommended):**
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

**With activated virtual environment:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### Custom Population Size

Specify a custom population size (must be divisible by 3):

**With UV:**
```bash
uv run python main.py 15000
```

**With activated virtual environment:**
```bash
python main.py 15000
```

The script will automatically adjust the population size to the nearest multiple of 3 if needed.

### Quick Start Example

```bash
# Complete workflow with UV
cd Home_assinment
uv venv                           # Create virtual environment
uv pip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies
uv run python main.py 6000        # Generate with 6,000 points

# Output:
# - Console statistics
# - gaussian_overlap_analysis.png (visualization)
```

### Output

The script generates:
1. **Console output** with:
   - Progress messages for each pipeline stage
   - Detailed statistical summaries (means, std dev, covariances)
   - Overlap analysis with PDF threshold information
   - Validation results (performance, overlap percentage)

### Comprehensive Population Size Comparison

The generator maintains consistent overlap characteristics across all tested population sizes:

| Population | Actual n | Points/Group | Overlap % | Overlap Count | Per-Group Overlap | Exec Time | Status |
|------------|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| 500        | 498      | 166          | 36.35%    | 181           | 34.3-37.4%        | 1.15s     | ⚠️ WARN* |
| 1,000      | 999      | 333          | 34.43%    | 344           | 33.9-35.4%        | 0.97s     | ✓ PASS |
| 3,000      | 3,000    | 1,000        | 31.87%    | 956           | 31.1-32.9%        | 1.35s     | ✓ PASS |
| 6,000      | 6,000    | 2,000        | 33.47%    | 2,008         | 32.4-35.2%        | 1.46s     | ✓ PASS |
| 10,000     | 9,999    | 3,333        | 33.04%    | 3,304         | 32.7-33.3%        | 1.59s     | ✓ PASS |

*Note: n=500 shows 36.35% overlap (slightly above 35% target). This is expected behavior for small sample sizes due to sampling variance.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Consistency**: Overlap percentage stabilizes at 30-35% for n ≥ 1,000
2. **Sampling Variance**: Smaller samples (n<1000) show more variance in overlap percentage
3. **Scalability**: Execution time scales linearly (O(n) complexity)
4. **Performance**: All tests complete well under the 5-second requirement
5. **Reliability**: Equal distribution maintained (exactly n/3 points per group)
6. **Statistical Convergence**: Sample statistics converge to true parameters as n increases
7. **Optimal Range**: n=3,000 to n=10,000 provides best balance of speed and accuracy

**Recommended Population Sizes by Use Case:**

| Use Case | Recommended n | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Quick testing / debugging | 1,000 | Fast execution (~1s) |
| Educational demonstrations | 3,000 | Clear visualization, good statistics |
| Standard analysis | 6,000 | Balanced density and performance |
| Production / ML training | 10,000 | Optimal statistical properties |
| Large-scale experiments | 30,000+ | Maximum accuracy (test separately) |

## Visualizations

### Dual-Panel Layout

The output visualization contains two panels:

#### Left Panel: Distribution View
- All data points color-coded by group (Red, Blue, Green)
- Mean markers (black X) for each distribution
- 95% confidence ellipses (2 standard deviations)
- Statistics box with point counts and overlap percentage
- Clear color coding with dark edges for professional quality

#### Right Panel: Overlap View
- Overlap region highlighted in yellow with orange edges
- Non-overlap points faded for clarity
- Convex hull polygon around overlap region
- Group-specific overlap counts and percentages
- Confidence ellipses shown with lighter styling

### Color Scheme

Following the specification:
- **Group 1**: Red (#FF0000) with dark red edges (#8B0000)
- **Group 2**: Blue (#0000FF) with dark blue edges (#00008B)
- **Group 3**: Green (#008000) with dark green edges (#006400)
- **Overlap Region**: Yellow (#FFFF00) fill with orange (#FFA500) edges
- **Background**: White
- **Grid**: Light gray (alpha=0.3)

### Understanding the Visualization

#### Left Panel: Distribution View
This panel shows the complete dataset with all three Gaussian distributions:

1. **Point Distribution**: Each group is clearly visible with its characteristic color (Red, Blue, Green), showing the natural spread of data points sampled from each Gaussian distribution.

2. **Mean Markers**: The black "X" markers indicate the sample mean calculated for each group. These should be very close to the true means ([2.0, 0.0], [-1.0, 1.732], [-1.0, -1.732]).

3. **Confidence Ellipses**: The dashed ellipses represent 2-sigma (approximately 95%) confidence regions for each distribution. These ellipses:
   - Are oriented based on the covariance matrix
   - Show the spread and correlation structure of each group
   - Overlap significantly in the center region, indicating ambiguous classification areas

4. **Statistics Box**: The wheat-colored box in the top-left shows:
   - Total number of points
   - Count per group (should be equal: n/3)
   - Overlap count and percentage

5. **Equilateral Triangle Pattern**: Notice how the three distribution centers form an equilateral triangle, with each mean positioned at radius 2.0 from the origin at angles 0°, 120°, and 240°.

#### Right Panel: Overlap View
This panel highlights the challenging overlap region where classification is ambiguous:

1. **Faded Background Points**: Non-overlap points are shown with very low opacity (alpha=0.15), making them nearly invisible. These are points that clearly belong to one distribution.

2. **Highlighted Overlap Points**: Points in yellow with orange edges are in the overlap region. These points have:
   - High probability density under multiple distributions
   - Minimum PDF > threshold (20% of center point's min PDF)
   - Ambiguous classification - could reasonably belong to multiple groups

3. **Convex Hull Boundary**: The orange polygon outlines the spatial extent of the overlap region. This boundary:
   - Encloses all overlap points
   - Is centered near the origin (0, 0)
   - Forms a roughly triangular shape due to the equilateral arrangement

4. **Confidence Ellipses**: Shown with dotted lines and reduced opacity to provide context without overwhelming the overlap visualization.

5. **Overlap Statistics Box**: The light yellow box shows how many points from each group fall into the overlap region, demonstrating that all three groups contribute roughly equally (~33% each).

### Key Insights from the Visualization

- **Symmetry**: The perfect equilateral triangle arrangement creates balanced overlap between all three pairs of distributions.

- **Overlap Concentration**: The overlap region is concentrated in the center, where all three distributions have significant probability density.

- **Classification Challenge**: Approximately 30-35% of points are in regions where multiple distributions overlap significantly, making them ideal test cases for clustering algorithms.

- **Statistical Validation**: The sample means closely match the true means, and the confidence ellipses accurately reflect the shared covariance structure.

### Data Characteristics

**Distribution Parameters:**
```python
Group 1: Mean = [2.0, 0.0],        Covariance = [[3.85, 0.0], [0.0, 3.85]]
Group 2: Mean = [-1.0, 1.732],     Covariance = [[3.85, 0.0], [0.0, 3.85]]
Group 3: Mean = [-1.0, -1.732],    Covariance = [[3.85, 0.0], [0.0, 3.85]]
```

**Spatial Properties:**
- **Inter-mean distance**: ~3.464 units (equal for all pairs due to equilateral triangle)
- **Standard deviation**: ~1.962 units in both X and Y dimensions
- **Overlap radius**: The center region (approximately within 1.5 units of origin) contains most overlap points
- **Mahalanobis distance** between centers: Constant due to symmetric arrangement

**Statistical Properties:**
- **Sample means** converge to true means as n increases (Central Limit Theorem)
- **Sample covariances** are unbiased estimates with Bessel's correction (n-1 denominator)
- **Overlap percentage** remains stable at 30-35% across different population sizes
- **Equal group contribution**: Each group contributes approximately 1/3 of overlap points

### Accessing the Data

The generator returns data in the following format:

```python
dataset = generate_gaussian_dataset(n=10000, seed=42)

# Structure:
{
    'data': np.ndarray,        # Shape: (n, 2) - All points
    'labels': np.ndarray,      # Shape: (n,) - Group labels (1, 2, 3)
    'params': dict,            # True distribution parameters
    'n_per_group': int         # Points per group (n/3)
}

# Example usage:
data = dataset['data']           # Get all points
labels = dataset['labels']       # Get group assignments
group_1_data = data[labels == 1] # Extract Group 1 points
```

---

## Statistical Analysis

### Calculated Metrics

For each distribution:
- **Sample mean vector** (2D)
- **True mean vector** (from generative parameters)
- **Sample covariance matrix** (2x2)
- **Standard deviations** for X and Y dimensions
- **Overlap percentage** (points within 95% confidence of ≥2 distributions)

### Overlap Detection Algorithm (PRD FR3)

Uses PDF-based method to identify ambiguous points:

```python
# Algorithm pseudocode:
For each point p:
  1. Calculate pdf1 = P(p | Distribution 1)
  2. Calculate pdf2 = P(p | Distribution 2)
  3. Calculate pdf3 = P(p | Distribution 3)
  4. min_pdf = min(pdf1, pdf2, pdf3)
  5. if min_pdf > threshold:
       p is in overlap region

# Threshold calculation:
1. center_point = (mean1 + mean2 + mean3) / 3
2. center_pdf1 = P(center_point | Distribution 1)
3. center_pdf2 = P(center_point | Distribution 2)
4. center_pdf3 = P(center_point | Distribution 3)
5. center_min = min(center_pdf1, center_pdf2, center_pdf3)
6. threshold = 0.20 * center_min
```

This method ensures:
- Points near the center (equidistant from all three distributions) are included
- Approximately 30-35% of total points fall in the overlap region
- Consistent results across different population sizes

## Key Concepts

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

The implementation uses MLE estimators for multivariate Gaussian distributions:

**Mean estimator:**
```
μ̂ = (1/n) Σ x_i
```

**Covariance estimator:**
```
Σ̂ = (1/(n-1)) Σ (x_i - μ̂)(x_i - μ̂)ᵀ
```

These estimators are:
- **Unbiased** (using Bessel's correction, n-1)
- **Consistent** (converge to true parameters as n → ∞)
- **Efficient** (achieve minimum variance among unbiased estimators)

### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

This project represents a 3-component GMM with:
- Equal mixing coefficients (π₁ = π₂ = π₃ = 1/3)
- Known component memberships (labeled dataset)
- Moderate overlap creating clustering ambiguity
- 30-35% of points in overlap region for testing clustering algorithms
